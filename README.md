# Precise Predictions: Classification for Flower and Tumors

This repository contains predictive models for flower classification and cancer tumor diagnosis using machine learning algorithms. The project includes Python notebooks with detailed step-by-step analyses and code for building and evaluating the predictive models.

## Overview
The project consists of two main predictive modeling tasks:
- Flower Classification: Building a model to predict the species of flowers based on their characteristics.
- Cancer Tumor Diagnosis: Developing a model to classify tumors as benign or malignant based on various features.

Both the tasks use logistic regression to provide insights into the likelihood of each outcome based on the input features. 
The Python notebook provides detailed explanations of the data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation processes for both tasks.

The code in this project is written in Python, and the primary libraries used include:
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Datasets
The datasets used for flower classification and cancer tumor diagnosis are provided as external links within the Python notebooks.
